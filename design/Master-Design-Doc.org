* Market Share Game Design Doc

** Concepts
*** Workers
*** Products
*** Sectors
*** R&D
- Bid/placement system to get companies? 
*** Mergers/Takeovers
Merger auctions idea (for more frequent auctions)
n = number of players
each round is a blind bid:
1. n
2. n-1
3. n-2
4. etc

Each round lowest bid is dropped  and becomes min bid for next round
*** Operations / Marketing?
Area majority market game using sectors

Some ideas
- Marketing - players commit cubes to a bag at the end of each round
- Cubes are drawn and players choose where to add them or some such

**** How do cubes get onto sectors?
- Opening a company adds a cube to a sector
- Marketing can add a cube to a sector (pull a cube from the bag) player chooses to increase his control in an area?
- Mergers can adjust cubes (non-matching mergers)
- Possibly a dungeon petz like hidden action bid system (features overbidding etc)
